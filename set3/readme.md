TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I still dont completely understand the binary search but i can understand it enough to pass, with the guessing games I understand errors and how they work.
With the loops it took me some time going back over them, but now I completely understand using a range and giving certain numbers with steps to provide different patterns with strings or numbers.
